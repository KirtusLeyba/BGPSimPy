We have chosen to detail the results of our experiment for 8 nations due to their histories of censorship practice. First we have chosen 4 nations known to enact
extensive Internet censorship policies. These nations are China, Turkey, Egypt, and Russia. China has historically been the number one nation in regards to Internet
censorship \cite{censorshipSurvey}. Turkey has recently dramatically increased its online censorship efforts, by blocking social media accesses during turmoil and pressuring ISPs
to block access to material chosen by the Turkish government \cite{turkeyCensor}. The Internet of Egypt suffered severe shutdowns during the Arab Spring of the early 2010s \cite{arabspring}.
The Russian government has passed surveillance laws requiring ISPs to allow the Russian government access to user statistics \cite{censorshipGeography}. Next we have chosen the nations
of Germany, the United States, France, and the United Kingdom because, while they have all conducted limited forms of Internet censorship \cite{censorshipSurvey}, Internet access for these 
nations is considered highly open.

\par
To inspect the changes over time for each nation we arrange all the border ASes belonging to a nation into a list. The list of border ASes is reverse sorted
so that the first AS has the highest chokepoint potential. The sum of all these chokepoint potentials is 1.0. Then we step through the list, and record
the cumulative chokepoint potential of all the ASes seen so far. If we plot the number of ASes controled vs the cumulative chokepoint potential for that number
of ASes, we can see how many ASes are required for a certain nation to control different percentages of paths. We repeat this process for each snapshot to highlight
changes over time.

\par
For instance, consider \figurename \ref{fig:multiTime}. 
The x-axis (log-scale, so that countries with large differences in AS counts can be compared more easily) for each plot
is the number of border ASes controlled, and the y-axis is the ratio of in-to-out paths intercepted. Each line represents a different snapshot, with the more red lines being
farther in the past and more blue lines being more recent.

\par
The United States and China are shown here and exhibit some dramatic differences. First, it is worth pointing out that the United States has many more ASes than China, hence
it's line extends further to the right in these plots. We also see that China, in all cases, can control a much larger portion of its paths with much fewer ASes than the
United States. This result is entirely expected. Of more interest is the trends that can be seen over time. The AS-level topology of China's Internet has evolved such that very few
ASes can intercept nearly all BGP paths. The US has evolved in a different way. While it has become somewhat easier for the US to intercept most of its paths, it has become
more difficult to intercept around 70\% of its paths and higher. This suggest an expansion of ASes on the interior and more connections, as well as a strengthening of
the very top ASes.

\par
Not all nations have evolved to a state where it easier to control paths. One example is Germany, as shown in \figurename \ref{fig:multiTime}. For Germany, a fairly constant
trend shows that it has become more difficult to intercept BGP paths. Unlike the other examples, any amount of German border ASes intercept less paths in more recent tests.

\par
In order to compare multiple nations, we have plotted the number of ASes needed to intercept 90\% of in-to-out paths
for each timestamp recorded. These results are detailed in \figurename \ref{fig:nodesFree} and \figurename \ref{fig:nodesCensor}.
The distinct behaviors of each nation are rather striking. We can see a steep decline for some
nations known to limit Internet freedom (China and Turkey) as well as the increase for other nations
(Germany and France). Other nations have stayed more stable. It is worth pointing out that if a nation
has required the same number of border ASes to control many paths over several years, this suggests
that the chokepoints have grown to intercept more paths. The reason for this is that the number of ASes,
and thus the number of paths, has increased globally over time. This fact makes the decline in ASes
needed for some nations even more glaring.


\subsection{Internet Freedom}

In our test of the relationship between Internet Freedom and national breakthrough potential, we plotted the Freedom on the Net score
of each nation vs the number of border ASes that that nation needed to in order to intercept 90\% of in-to-out paths. Additionally,
we evaluated the relationship with an Ordinarly Least Squares (OLS) fit, and found that the relationship was statistically significant,
with a p-value $\leq$ 0.002 for 2017. The relationship held for other timestamps as well. The results for 2017 are shown in figure \ref{fig:fotn}

	of those nations in 2017. A higher FOTN score indicates a less free nation. Our OLS fit is also plotted.}\label{fig:fotn}
\end{figure}

	\caption{The National Breakthrough Potential (in-to-out) for nations plotted against the FPI
	of those nations in 2017. A higher FPI indicates a less free nation. Our OLS fit is also plotted.}\label{fig:fotp}
\end{figure}

\par
For each timestamp we see what appears to be two general modes of behavior. Nations that are not free or partly free tend to requrie few ASes
to intercept 90\% of their paths. Free nations on the otherhand require varying degrees of large numbers of ASes to control the same portion
of their paths. There are interesting outliers for both situations, however. Countries like Estonia (EE) or Iceland (IS) are very free but require
few border ASes to control most of their paths. The reason for these outliers is likely that their overall AS counts are very low. On the other hand, Russia (RU)
is a very interesting outlier in that it is found to be not free by FOTN, but requires a large number of ASes to control most of its paths. This suggests
that the censorship efforts in Russia might be of types that do not require AS level chokepoints.
